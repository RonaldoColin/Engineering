            9/23/2022 This week we did our golberd machine and we did it, I don't remember challenge day but i'm guessing my group skipped it because we were beind on the golberd machine, we finished it and it all went well, we finished it.

               9/30/2022 Mr.Poole got covid and he couldn't come to class for the whole week. We started to design a Prosthetic for any kind of animal and I designed a prosthetic for a elephant leg, because a lot of elephants loose legs and they are funny/big creatures. The class wanted to do a challenge day but Mr.Poole was absent so instead we just worked on our prosthetics in the time being.

              10/7/2022 Mr.Poole came back from covid and he got mad at me because I didn't do my work, that day i went home and did all the work, lol. Basically this week we learned about Computer Engineering and we had to take apart a laptop, fill in some worksheet and after we fill in that worksheet we turn it in and we try to put the laptops back on, but no one did. For challenge day we had to see if there was more wheels or doors in the campus and my side of the classroom got wheels, I'm sure there were more wheels then doors in the campus tho. Me and my partner went out and we caculated it, We were not close, very far but in all, we did very well.

            10/14/2022 This week was a good week, We looked about aerospace engineering slides and we learned it. After that Mr.Poole announced that we had to make a bottle rocket next week and try to get it over the field goal or close to the field goal. For challenge day Mr.Poole gave us a paper and he made us get as close to or into a barrel, and most people made a paper airplane (including my group) but there were some people that made a ball, which was actually the best thing you could do in that situation. Ours was almost deadlast but it was a experience of a lifetime. WE also started to design our tinkercad for the rocket.

            10/21/2022 This week we designed our bottle rockets, last week we designed a tinkercad for our rocket, or we started it. My group said we'll use coke and mentos. Our group started making our project and it went out good, but someone pointed out that you can use a lighter cardboard for your fins and that we should add paper around it to support it because we had a little hole from the glue gun because it was so hot it melted our 2L coke bottle. We did it and our group did horrible, First time our group used coke and mentos it went bad becuase someone already shaked it and the carbonation was gone from it. Then after that we added water to it and it worked pretty well, but I was suprised because I thought a lot of people's project would go flying but no ones did, most of ours just hit the floor or went in a loop. But I guess that is common for a high school engineering class.

             10/28/2022 This week we looked at Enviormental engineering slides and we learned a lot, After tht Mr.Pool challenged us to make a water purifier and my group nd me did very good in the project, or water was almost clear. I also drank it because of how clear it was.

            11/4/2022 This week we learned Electrical Engineering, Mr.Poole gave us slides and we all listened carefully, I was really into Electrical Engineering because my dad is a Electrician and I want to learn more, because of curiosity so basically I've listen to his slides and then Mr.Poole announced we had a Quiz and we did the Quiz, and im sure i got like a 70-80% on the Quiz but I have no idea. After that Mr.Poole made us do a worksheet and told us that we're going to be doing the same thing but not on Tinkercad but in real life. I was so excited to hear this I almost jumped out of my seat.

            11/10/2022 This week we started doing the Arduino board, For the first day I didn't know what I was doing but Mr.Poole helped me out, We created some circuits and I experimented a little, thank god I didn't short the bulb. The second day we did the same thing but with a multimeter, and me and my parenter did really good, I had a lot of fun doing it too and I was interestee in this beause my dad is a Electrician. Mr.Poole also helped us a lot which im thankful of. For the challenge day, We got a paper and had to decide if you would take a Math Class or if you would count to 1 Million, and my group choose Math Class rather then countng to 1 million. This week I had fun, like I always do. <br>

            11/18/2022 This week we programmed our Arduino board, To be honest I had no idea what we were doing but Mr.Poole like always, helped me out a lot. I programmed my arduino board really well, in my opinion. It was also really fun to do it with my partner, But I encountered a problem, right before the last day I didn't finish so I had to finish it at the end of the week, I barely finished it with 5 minutes to rest, So I'm doing my website at home for homework. In all, That was really fun and I would definetly do it again. For challenge day there was a lake called "Lake Carcinogen" and There were 2 chemicals in it, Bromide + Chlorine. Those were safe to drink, but If you add the sun to it, it makes "Bromate" which causes cancer and which is really bad. 600,000 people use the lake, its 10 square acres, and 60 million gallons i believe, My solution to that problem was to get a filter, that removes Bromate from the water, Theres a main pipe that goes to all the houses, so in the main pipe we would add a filter, which is pre-made and would take 1-2 days to install, Using the engineers and mechanics from the neighborhood, or anyone that will help us. And then boom, people get safe drinking water, cancer free. But the problem is, It would take too long. The solution Mr.Poole told us about, which they really used was small rubber balls that floated on the surface, which took a short time, just get them and dump them in the water, Plus there only $0.60 dollars, which is pretty cheap. But I had fun this week and I look forward to next week aka thanksgiving and aka we have 1 week off :)!

               12/2/2022 This week we learned about Civil Engineering, We learned about the different typed of Civil Engineering, I was most interested in Infanstructure engineering (excuse my spellng). We had to build a bridge to support a bucket with water, I was really scared for this challenge but later I found out it might be easy because we have 3 weeks to do it and Mr.Poole will help us a lot. For challenge day we didn't do anything, and I'm kinda sad because I lke challenge day. I'm going to write a "documentation" or a "journal" for ur bridge and hope I get a good grade.

                12/9/2022 This week all we did was build our bridges, and I think my group made our bridge pretty well, For challenge day which was super fun Mr.Poole bought a game called "Freeways" I had that game on my phone so I told him I had it, and then when it was class time he didn't let me do any of it and so we ended up loosing to another group, 2-4 (we were 2) if i'm correct, I also told Mr.Poole I hate him, and I regret saying that, I was just mad we lost because I couldn't do anything. But this week we had fun, and I also wrote the "documentation/journal" for our bridge, and I just wanna get a good grade in this class.

                1/13/2023 Ths week was the returning week from christmas break, My christmas break was fun. This week, we started to learn about "shark tank" and how we're going to start "making" a new shark tank product, and show it to 3 staff members, including Mr.Poole. For challenge day we didn't do anything except start making our slides for our shark tank product. My group me, Alex A and Parth did a cable cutter, that cut the cables. Mr.Poole said we're

                1/20/2023 This week me and my group, we started to present our shark tank tool, and me and my group did pretty god. Which I'm so happy about. We didn't do challenge day this week. But I'm still kinda happy.

                1/27/2023 This week with Mr.Poole we made oobleck and it was a really fun experience. Me and my friend we made ooleck and we had a lot of fun, but we were scared of gettng it on our sweater. Then, later in the week we had to make a project, a Moustrap car, A arduino car, or a idea of the school, to make its structure better. Me and abdul picked arduino car and we started working on it. We fought a lot, but we are having fun while doing this.

                2/3/2023 This week was a bad week. We had to evacuate from school because some guy came in and walked around the school. Me and abdul got a lot done this week, This week we worked on our tinkercad for our arduino car, and we did most of it in class but we had to do a little bit of it on the weekend so we did that. Abdul wasn't here on thursday when we did the challenge day so I had to work with Alex, We made a post it bridge, but in all honesty it was really bad. We cut the sticky part of the bridge, and we taped that together but it didn't work, we made a new way so we got the ones that were not sticky, and we put it in the middle of 2 sticky ones, which was good but we did bad. This week was good, but it was also dramatic.

                  2/10/2023 This week was a very nice week, me and abdul started to work on the base of the car + the supports. We did nice, but we did a small tweak in our structure of the car. We found out it was best to make 2 "layers". The bottom one that holds the motor, and the top one that holds all the arduino board and connections. Plus we had extra space to work with it. For challenge day, this week we had a meter stick, and we had to make a waterballon stay on the end of the meter with posticle sticks and rubber bands. + you only can hold on the end 10cm of the stick. My group went with the "leaning style" is what we call. We made the other ones weak, but we made 1 side, super strong. During my run (we have to run 10 yards, and get to the end) I got 2nd place in the run, and I felt confident. It broke mid-way but it was still strong and functional. One thing I would fix is the fact that the other sides were weak, I would support it a little more.
